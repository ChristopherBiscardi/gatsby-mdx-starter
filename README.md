# Gatsby Starter Pack

This is my own opinionated setup for what a Gatsby default baseline should be. I began with [gatsby-starter-default v2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and started making modifications and enhancements from there.

### Changelog

- 9/12/18
  - remove `yarn.lock` (I prefer using npm)
  - modify `.prettierrc` settings
  - run prettier as a pre-commit git hook
  - add basic eslint integration and npm script
  - add prop-types package
