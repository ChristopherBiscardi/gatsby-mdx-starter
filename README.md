# Gatsby MDX Starter

This is my own opinionated setup for what a Gatsby default baseline should be. I began with [gatsby-starter-default v2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and started making modifications and enhancements from there. This is still a work in progress for the time being.

### Todo

- ~~mdx (or filestystem plugin combined w/ markdown plugin)~~
- update prettier to support mdx
- ~~styled components or emotion~~
- ~~typography~~
- better encapsulation of react-live css. alternatively, submit PR back to react-live so they can better support "bring your own styles"
- ~~support frontmatter in .md and .mdx~~
- ~~better 404 page~~
- gatsby image
- Setup storybook (or similar)
- Add test suite
  - Jest
  - react-testing-library
  - cypress
  - add to the precommit routine
    - [pre-commit](https://github.com/observing/pre-commit) or [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) might help
