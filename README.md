### Gatsby MDX Starter

This Gatsby starter intends to be a full featured boilerplate for getting started with an MDX powered blog.

### Todo

- update prettier to support mdx
- local mdx images (see issue @ gatsby-mdx)
- index page pagination
- keyword search
- tag filtering
- posts template (next, previous, title, date, etc)
- google analytics
- page for popular posts (powered by analytics)
- about page
- commenting system
- better encapsulation of react-live css. alternatively, submit PR back to react-live so they can better support "bring your own styles"
- Setup storybook (or similar)
- Add test suite
  - Jest
  - react-testing-library
  - cypress
  - add to the precommit routine
    - [pre-commit](https://github.com/observing/pre-commit) or [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) might help
